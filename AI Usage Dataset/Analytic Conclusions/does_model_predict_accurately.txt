>> Analysis for the Linear Model:
- Very strong fit both in training and testing.
- The model generalizes well, meaning the linear relationship between predictors and exam scores is consistent

For the MSE:
- On average, predictions are off by about 25 points squared error.
- Indicates reasonably good accuracy given the scale of exam scores (0–100)

>> Analysis for the Random Forest Model:
For Training:
- Extremely high — the model almost perfectly fits the training data.
- The Suggests strong learning capacity but also potential overfitting

For Testing:
- Still strong, but noticeably lower than training.
- Confirms some overfitting: the model captures noise in training that doesn’t generalize well

- Slightly worse than the linear regression’s error.
- Despite higher training accuracy, the random forest does not outperform linear regression on unseen data


Linear regression: More stable, less prone to overfitting, and slightly better test error.
Random forest: More flexible, captures complex patterns, but overfits and loses generalization power.
