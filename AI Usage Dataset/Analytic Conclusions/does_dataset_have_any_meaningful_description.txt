## Skewness is a statistical measure of the asymmetry of a probability distribution.
## A positive skew (right tail) means “a few very high values, many lower values,” and a negative skew (left tail) means the opposite;

>>> The dataset shows that the average exam score is about 59.5 with a median of 59. Most student have an exam score of about 81 marks. Henceforth the dataset is skewed to the right slightly (positively skewed) (students with lower exam scores). However a larger group of students score high (81) than the average pass (59.5).

>>> The average final score is fairly low at about 56.8 with a median of 56.9. Most students passed fairly above average with a final score of about 60.7 marks (percentage). The dataset is slightly right‑skewed or approximately symmetric.

>>> The dataset show us that though the average AI Dependency score is about 5.5 with a median of 6.0, most students depend less on AI (or choose to stick with traditional methods BUT this should be checked against the actual distribution, not just mean/median/mode.). The dataset is skewed to the left (negatively skewed) (students with higher AI Dependency Scores)

>>> The average ai_usage_minutes is 88.98 ~= to the median of 89.0. The data is skewed to the right (positively skewed) slightly

>>> The study_hours_per day is fairly balanced with a mean of 3.287, a median of 3.3 and a mode of 3.8. mean, median, and mode are close, so say they are clustered around 3–4 hours. The data is skewed slightly to the left (negative skew)

Variance of Study Hours Per Day: 2.5029506210937496

>>> Last exam and final scores: “These variances show that exam scores vary quite a lot between students, with last exam scores more spread out than final scores.”
>>> AI dependency and study hours: “These variances are small, meaning most students are clustered fairly close to the average dependency score and study hours.”
>>> AI usage minutes: “This variance is large, consistent with usage times ranging from almost 0 up to around 180 minutes; students differ widely in how long they use AI.”
